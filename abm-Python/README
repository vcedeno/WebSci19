To run execute run.all:
python src/abm.py input.json

This calls abm.py that uses configuration file input.json. 

#*.json
Each file contains a simulation definition. This includes: 

-function definition
*h1 to execute simulation
*h2 to compare real experiments and simulation
-number of iterations
-graph file definition
-model for action selection (probability matrix file)
-word distribtuion file
-letter request distribution file
-fraction of letters to reply distribution file
-times for letter reply distribution file
-number of nodes
-number of edges
-game duration in seconds
-seed value
-experiment id
-for each player specify id, corpus file, corpus name, vocabulary, aptitude in word, aptitude in letter request, type of behavior in replying to letter request and actual initial letters
